These are some examples of why you should use it.Loading state management Loaders handle the loading state for you, providing a clear indication of when data is being fetched. This helps you manage loading spinners, progress indicators, or any other UI elements related to data loading. <br/> Error handling Loaders often include error handling mechanisms, allowing you to handle and display errors that occur during the data loading process.

It’s also probably one of the most hidden language concepts. We use it every time we write any React code, most of the time without even realizing it. But there is no getting away from them in the end: if we want to write complex and performant React apps, we have to know closures."
